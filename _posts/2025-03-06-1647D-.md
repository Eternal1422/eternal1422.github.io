title: "1896D Ones and Twos"

The problem can be found [here](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1896/D)

### My Thought Process 
Let's begin with some small cases. Looking at $n=3$, we have the following possible arrays and the possible sums of the subarray. 
$$1, 1, 1 : 1, 2, 3$$
$$1, 1, 2 : 1, 2, 3, 4$$
$$1, 2, 1 : 1, 2, 3, 4$$
$$2, 1, 1 : 1, 2, 3, 4$$
$$2, 2, 1 : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$
$$1, 2, 2 : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$
$$2, 1, 2:  1, 2, 3, 5$$
$$2, 2, 2 : 2, 4, 6$$

Ok, some obvious things we can see that if the array is all ones, we can have subarray sums of [1, n] and if its all twos we can have all the even numbers in the same range. 

The only other weird array is $2, 1, 2$ as it doesn't have all the values in $[1. n]$. 

We should think about the problem again. Why does the problem only allow for 1s and 2s? Are there something special about these numbers. If it was any number, how would the problem be different? 

Parity might be important here then. Starting with our array, how might we cut some prefix and suffix to get our desired subarray sum? If we want an even array and have an even array starting sum, how does removing 1s and 2s affect the sum? 

After testing another case with an even sum $2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1$, we notice that something interesting. With the starting sum, we can always remove numbers from the beginng and end of the array to subtract two from the sum. This is clear as we can either remove two 1s or one 2. This keeps partiy and allow us to get even numbers less than the sum of the starting array. 

Okay, wait, that mean if we also have an odd sum array, we could obtain all odds number less than or equal to it? This should apply to subarrays too so we just need to find a subarray thats greater than the value we need to find and having the same partiy. 

Since ones change the partiy, we only need to look at where those are in the array. Finding the first one from the front or the back will allow us to change the partiy of the array while not decreasing the sum of the array too much!

### Implementation  
I probably should've thought a bit harder because it took me a while to implement but here it is.
