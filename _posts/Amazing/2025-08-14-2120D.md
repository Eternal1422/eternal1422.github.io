### Thoughts
This was a pretty standard combinatorics problem, but still pretty interesting. Seems complicated at first but after trying to figure out a formula for the answer, it got quite a bit easier. 

### My Thought Process 
Okay, this seems like a combinatorics problem (we are asked to find large integers MOD something and that integer isn't the # of _____). 

We need to figure out how Harshith will play optimally so lets keep that in mind as we look at the sample case with $a = 2$, $b = 2$, $k = 2$ to get some ideas. 

The answer to this case is $(3, 7)# but how does the matrix actually look like? We should build the array column by column.
