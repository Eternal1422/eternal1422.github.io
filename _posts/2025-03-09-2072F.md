### My Thought Process 
Ok, this problem reminds me of this [CSES Problem](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2419) but its probably quite different/

Lets look at the example cases. An interesting thing about them is that it seems that each row is either $0$ or $k$.

This makes sense because we are either xoring $k$ with $k$ or $0$. 

This also means that $k$ is essentially irrelevant to the problem.

![example](C:\Users\etern\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Eternal1422.github.io\eternal1422.github.io\assets\Screenshot_2025-03-09_173529.png)

This seems like a pretty simple pattern actually. 

### Implementation
