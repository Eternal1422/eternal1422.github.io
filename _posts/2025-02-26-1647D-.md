### My Thought Process 
Ok so, good numbers are in the form of $kd$ for some $d$. Then, the product of two good numbers would be $a * b * d^2$ for some $a$ and $b$. Beautiful numbers then shouldn't be multiples of $d^2$ maybe? Yeah this seems about right, if a number is a multiple of $d$ and is not a multiple of $d^2$, it cannot be respresented as two good numbers and is necessarily beautiful.

Now, lets turn our attention to representing a number as a product of two beautiful nuumbers. Obviously, $d \mid x$
