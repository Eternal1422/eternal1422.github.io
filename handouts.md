Thanks to Evan Chen for his .sty file which is used for all the handouts here. It can be found [here](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty).

The handout covers the basics of manipulating algebraic equations in math competitions. Its mainly for the AMC 12 and AIME but includes a few easy olympiad problems. It includes factoring, logarithms, exponents, and SSFT. It is quite short but includes a good amount of problems. (01/06/2025)
